# RMA-2k16
Blind Tic-Tac-Toe university project using TCP/IP

## Principle
### V1.
Player A starts the game and faces an AI in a local game. 
Player A doesn't see the AI (Player B) moves unless he tries to do a move on somewhere the AI has already played. If so, this specific move is unveiled on Player A's board.

### V2.
Two players face each other
Player A doesn't see what Player B does and so on.

The game ends when either :
> One of the players completed a line without being interrupted by the other (horizontal, diagonal, vertical)

> The board is filled up (Draw)
#### Addons
Players can disconnect during game.
Players can replay without having to reconnect manually
Players can play online or against an AI directly from the same executable
